out and in object
-----------------
out is an object of PrintStream class
Code to create this object(out) is written inside System class
in is an object of InputStream class
Code to create this object(in) is written inside System class

Remember out is a reference variable and it holds reference of PrintStream class
Remember in is a reference variable and it holds reference of InputStream class
Both variables are declared inside System class and both variables are static

println() and print() is a non-static method of PrintStream class
Our program can call this method to display value/data on console window
Syatem.out.println("Welcome");

Constructor of Scanner class
----------------------------
It accepts reference of object of InputStream class
So we will have to pass reference of InputStream class object to the constructor of Scanner class
class AA
{
  static int x=90;
}
Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
Remember constructors or methods accept value(Value could be reference of object also)
