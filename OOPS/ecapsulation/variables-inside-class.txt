Instance variables
------------------
Those variables that are declared/defined inside class without using static modifier are known as instance variables.These variables are also known as non-static variables
Command to create instance variable is executed each time class is instantiated(Object from class is created)
So instance variables can have multiple copies in memory

Class variables
---------------
Those variables that are declared/defined inside class by using static modifier are known as class variables.These variables are also known as static variables
Command to create static variable is executed when class is loaded in memory.Remember class is loaded only once in memory.So static variable can have only one copy in memory

Remember memory allocation of instance variable is dynamic and memory allocation of class variable is static

public class Demo
{
   int x; //Command to create instance variable
   static int y;//Command to create class variable
}
