Object oriented programming
---------------------------
Java is an object oriented programming language
An object oriented program creates one or more than one objects during execution
Methods called by that program will be executed on these objects 

Object can also be container of data in mmeory like variable

Object vs variable
-------------------
1)Variable can hold single data while object can hold multiple data
2)Variable can not be shared among methods while object can be shared among methods
3)Variable is named container while object is referenced container
4)Keeping data into variable will be visible while keeping data into object can be hidden

What is object?
---------------
Every real world entity is an object
Every object has state.Object is identified by states
Every object has two properties
1)Arrtibute
2)Behaviour

What is class?
--------------
It is template or blueprint from which objects are created
You can say it is blueprint of the object
Inside this class you will have to define following:
1)Instance variables(variables):Optional
2)Constructors(special type of methods):Mandatory
3)Getters and setters(methods):Optional
