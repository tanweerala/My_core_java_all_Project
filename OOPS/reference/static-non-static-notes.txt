Static method and non-static method
------------------------------------

Defining static method
----------------------
We can define static method by using static keyword in method declaration
public static void show()
{
  //command
}
Remember instance variables can not be used inside static method
If you do not want to use instance variables inside method then make that method static.Object reference is not required to call static methods.Class name is required to call methods

Defining non-static method
--------------------------- 
We can define non-static method without using static keyword in method declaration
public void show()
{
  //command
}
Remember instance variables can be used inside non-static method
If you want to use instance variables inside method then make that method non-static.Object reference is required to call static methods.Class name can not be used to call non-static methods
