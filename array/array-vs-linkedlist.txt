We can create data structure using array as well as linked list
1)Size of the array is fixed.It can neither grow nor shrink
1)Size of the linked list is not fixed.It can grow and shrink
2)Memory allocation of the array is static
2)Memory allocation of the linked list is dynamic
3)Memory allocation is congiguous
3)Memory allocation is scattered
Note:array uses less memory w.r.t to linkedlist
