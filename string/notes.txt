String handling
===============
Set of characters is known as string
"8810436567" is a string
"Rehan Ahmad" is a string
"rehanahmad9919@gmail.com" is a string
char type array should be created by program in memory to hold/keep string
In java code to create this array is predefined in following three classes
1)String class
2)StringBuffer class
3)StringBuilder class
These three classes are in default package(java.lang package)

String str1=new String("Rohan");
StringBuffer str2=new StringBuffer("Amit");
StringBuilder str3=new StringBuilder("Rahul");

Note:Reference of the object can not be shown in java

Code to print reference of the object will be changed by compiler
This code will be as follows

String str1=new String("Rohan");
System.out.println(str1);
Compiler will change above command and it should be as follows
System.out.println(str1.toString());
Here value returned by toString() method will be printed
Remember toString() is a method of Object class
so every java class has toString() method
