String class
=============
It is an immutable class
Immutable means non modifiable
If class is immutable then object of that class will also be immutable
So string hold by String class object can not be modified/changed
While StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes are mutable

Imp note:Object of String class is created by default for each string and reference of the object is returned

String str="CETPA";
For the value "CETPA" an object of String class will be created by default in constant pool and reference of that object is returned

Imp note:For same string, only one object of String class will be created

String str1="CETPA";
String str2="CETPA";
String str3="CETPA";
