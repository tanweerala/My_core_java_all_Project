Class variable:Those variables that are declared by using static modifier inside class are known as class variables/static variables
Only one copy of static variable is created in memory

Instance variable::Those variables that are declared without using static modifier inside class are known as instance variables/non-static variables
These variables are create each time object from the class is created

public class AA
{
  int x; //command to create instance variable
  static int y;//command to create class variable
}

Command to create instance variable is executed each time object from class is create
Command to create class variable is executed when class is loaded in memory.Remember a class is loaded only once in memory




static variable should be accessed by class name but it can be accessed by object's reference also
static method should be called by class name but it can be called by object's reference also
