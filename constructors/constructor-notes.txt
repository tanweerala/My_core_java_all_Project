Constructor
-----------
Without constructor object can not be created
So every class must have atleast once constructor
It is a special type of method
Name of constructor must be the name of class
Constructor has no return type .If return type is given then that constructor wil lnot be constructor.It will be a method
Constructors can not be called exiplicitily
It means we can not write code to call constructor
Code to create object has code to calll constructor also
Constructor should have object's initialization command
(Command to assign first time value to the instance variable is called initialization of object)
Note:So constructor is used to initialize object

Types of constructors
---------------------
There are three types of constructor
1)Default constructor
2)Parameterized constructor
3)Copy constructor


Default constructor
-------------------
This is the constructor that is inserted by compiler into class file of the class
This is a non-parameterized/no-argument constructor
Compiler inserts this constructor inside class file when source code of the class has no constructor
Object will be initialized by default value when this constructor will be executed

Parameterized constructor
--------------------------
Define this constructor inside source code of the class to initialized object by explicit value(Value given by user or program or value fetched from database)
