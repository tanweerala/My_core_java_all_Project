Compilation
-----------
It is a prcoess in which source code is converted into executable code
Following two activities are performed during compilation
1)Parsing:Errors will be checked inside source code
2)Translation:Souce code will be translated into machine understandable code
This is done by compiler
Java compiler does not generate machine code
It generates byte code
This byte code will be interpreted by JVM at runtime
