Thread synchronization
----------------------
It is required when your program wants to 
1)Allow access of shared object to only one thread at a time.Object must be synchronized in this case
2)Allow invocation of method on shared object to only one thread at a time.Method must be synchronized in this case
3)Allow execution of block of method on shared object to only one thread at a time.Block of method must be synchronized in this case

Creating synchronized object
=============================
If all public method of the class are synchronized then that class is called synchronized class.
Object of this class is also called synchronized 
public class AA
{
  public synchronized void method1()
  {
	//command
  }
  public synchronized void method2()
  {
	//command
  }
  public synchronized void method3()
  {
	//command
  }
}  
Defining synchronized method
=============================
public class AA
{
  public synchronized void method1()
  {
	//command
  }
  public void method2()
  {
	//command
  }
  public void method3()
  {
	//command
  }
}  

Defining synchronized block
=============================
public class AA
{
  public void method1()
  {
	command1
	command2
	command3
	sycnronized(this)
	{
	  command4`mmand5
	  command6
	}
	command7
	command8
	command9
  }
}
