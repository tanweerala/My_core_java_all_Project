Runnable interface
==================
It has only one method.The method is as follows
public void run()
This interface is already implemented by Thread class
As we know we will have to override run() method
We can ovveride run() method by following two ways
1)By implementing Runnable interface
2)By extending Thread class

1)First way
public class Task implements Runnable
{
  public void run()
  {
	//Write code ot perform task
  }
}

2)Second way
public class Task extends Thread
{
  public void run()
  {
	//Write code ot perform task
  }
}
