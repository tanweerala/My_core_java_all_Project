Multithreading
==============
It is one of the way to achieve multitasking
Multitasking means performing more than one tasks simultaneously
Multitasking application creates and starts more than one threads at a time(per task one thread)

Thread
-------
It is smallest unit of processing
In java every thread is represented in the form of objects
This object should be created either from Thread class or from the child of Thread class
Every thread should be treated as a small program having run() method
This run() method will be called autometically when thread will get change for exeuction
We will have to override run() method only
Inside this method we will have to write code to perform task
