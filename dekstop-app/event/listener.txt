Defining/creating event listener/handler
-----------------------------------------
We will have to build this program(listener/handler) according to the event to be handled by this program
If event is ActionEvent then build ActionListener
If event is MouseEvent then build MouseListener
If event is KeyEvent then build KeyListener
If event is FocusEvent then build FocusListener

Here ActionListener,MoyseListener,KeyListener and FocusListener are predefined interfaces
ActionEvent,MouseEvent,KeyEvent and FocusEvent are predefined classes
java.awt.event package contains these classes and interfaces

We will have to create/define class of listener by implementing one of the above interfaces

public class MyListener implements ActionListener
{
  
}
