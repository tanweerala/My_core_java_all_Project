====
It is a keyword and it holds the reference of current class object
It is used to access instance variables.As we know instance variable can not be accessed without the reference of object

Command to access/use instance variable must be as follows
object's reference.variablename
As we know "this" holds reference of current class object so inside current class above code must be as follows
this.variablename
this. will be associated by compiler

public class AA
{
  private int num;
  public AA(int n)
  {
	num=n;//this.num=n;
  }
  public void square()
  {
	int sq=num*num;//int sq=this.num*this.num;
  }
}

public class Product
{
  private int pid;
  private String name;
  private String brand;
  private int price;
  public Product(int pid,String name,String brand,int price)
  {
