Exception handling
------------------
During execution of program, some abnormal/exceptional conditions might be occurred
These abnormal conditions are known as exceptions
If program will not handle these exceptions then program will not be able to continue execution
It means execution of program will be terminated
If program will handle exception then execution of program will not be terminated

Following three activities are performed during exception and exception handling
1)Creating exception:Code to create exception is predefined
2)Thrwoing exception:Code to throw exception is predefined
3)Catching exception:Code to catch exception should be written by you

Creating exception
------------------
An object is created and information about the exception is stored in this object
This object is created by either JVM or API(Predefined methods an constructors called by our program)

Throwing exception
------------------
After creating exception(object), JVM or API sends reference of that object to the program.This is called throwing exception

Catching exception
------------------
Program must accept reference of exception(object)
Aceepting reference of exception is called catching exception
