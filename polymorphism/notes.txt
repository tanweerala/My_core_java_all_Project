Polymorphism
------------
It means many forms
An entity having many forms
It reduces code complexity
There are two types of polymorphism
1)Static polymorphism
2)Dynamic polymorphism 

Static polymorphism
--------------------
An entity existing in different physical forms simultanesouly has this polymorphism
It is achieved by method overloading
This polymorphism is also known as compile time polymorphism

Dynamic polymorphism
--------------------
An entity changing it's form depending upn circumstances has this polymorphism
It is achieved by method overriding
This polymorphism is also known as runtime polymorphism
