Invocation of super/parent class constructor
---------------------------------------------
Child/sub class constructor always calls constructor of parent/super class.It is mandatory
So during construction of child class object constructor of child class as well as parent class will be executed
This is achieved by following command
super();
This command will be inserted by compiler inside the constructor of every class
This command will be first statement of every constructor
This command will call default/non-parameterized constructor of parent class
