Method overriding
------------------
To redefine parent class method into child class is called method overriding
Child class will override parent class method in following two situations
1)Child class wants to change/modify implementation of parent class method
2)Patent class method has no implementation(abstract method)


Method overriding rules
-----------------------
1)Argument list of both method must be same
2)Return type of both method must be same
3)Child class method should not be less accessible than the parent class method

Note:
i)If parent class method is final then child class can not override that method
ii)If parent class method is private then it will not be inherited by child class so there is no question of method overriding
