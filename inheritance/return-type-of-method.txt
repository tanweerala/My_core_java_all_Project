Return type of method
----------------------
As we know every method must have a return type
It could be void,int,float,boolean,etc
Return type of method can also be non-primitive(All classes and interfaces)
If return type of method is void then that method can not return any value to the caller
If return type of method is not void(primitive or non-primitive) then that method must return a value to the caller.In this case implementation(body) of method must have return statement
